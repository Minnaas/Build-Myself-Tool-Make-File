# Build-Myself-Tool-Make-File
Build a Makefile that  has the same functionality  almost like a IDE (Bassiclly) help you code programing language C/C++ without needing  to use IDE such as: Visual Studio, Code Block,...

File architecture:

\---Project
    +---Sources
    |   +---Folder0
    |   |       main.c
    |   |       
    |   +---Folder1
    |   |       file1_1.c
    |   |       file1_1.h
    |   |       
    |   \---Folder2
    |           file2_1.c
    |           file2_1.h
    |           file2_2.c
    |           file2_2.h
    \---Build
        |   Makefile
        |   myApp.exe
        |   
        +---Folder0
        |       main.d
        |       main.o
        |       
        +---Folder1
        |       file1_1.d
        |       file1_1.o
        |       
        \---Folder2
                file2_1.d
                file2_1.o
                file2_2.d
                file2_2.o
